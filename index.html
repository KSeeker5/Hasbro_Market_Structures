	<h1>Brief Overview</h1>
	<p>
		Hasbro, Inc. (an abbreviation of its original name, Hassenfeld Brothers) is an American multinational toy and board game company. Hasbro is the third largest toy maker in the world with revenues of approximately $4.45 billion. Hasbro acquired the trademarks and products of Kenner, Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley, among others. Among its toy and game products are the iconic Monopoly board game, G.I. Joe figurine, Furby electronic stuffed animal, Transformers mechanical toys and My Little Pony. The Hasbro brand also spawned TV shows, such as Family Game Night on the Discovery Family network, to promote its products. The corporate headquarters is located in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The majority of its products are manufactured in East Asia.

	<h1>Stock Recommendation</h1>
	<p>
		After researching the history of the company and looking at its current line up in products and the stock price I have determined that this is a buy tock. Since this is a toy based company after the school supplies split up with them, the company has only been getting stronger and stronger. I believe that this price is only going to increase for more and more of their products are going to be bought with the ever growing population. This will be a very slow growing stock, but over time this stock will continue to increase making it a good buy.
